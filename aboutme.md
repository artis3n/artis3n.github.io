title: About me
subtitle: Thoughts on software development, application security, and cryptography.
---

I am a cyber security engineer performing penetration tests and writing secure software. This means the posts will
    usually be on cyber security-related topics or software engineering. I am passionate about cryptography so there will be a good number of crypto posts as well.

I have no current plan on a regular cadence for posts; as I come across topics that interest me, I will dive into them and write up what I learn. There are also topics that I would like a chance at explaining, so posts will contain a mix of 'teaching' articles as well. I may re-write articles multiple times as my understanding of a topic grows and I realize how badly I've misinformed you.

Thanks!
